# Description

Given a data (Source IP, Destination IP), you can find the implementation of an event-based jumping window structure (russing sum algorithm),
that enables frequency queries over the stream.

The outcome is given a data with 3 columns :   
- the time of query arrival
- the queried IP
- the query window size 

We give an estimation of the frequency of the values stored in the data.
