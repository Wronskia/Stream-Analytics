# Description
Internet service providers and large companies frequently deploy network monitoring
algorithms for protecting their network from malicious attacks and unlawful actions, and for
identifying possible misconfigurations and faults. These algorithms are sometimes installed
at the edge routers of the corporate network, for keeping track of all incoming and outgoing
networks. In this repo, I present a set of sketches and algorithms that  help
 to efficiently (in real time) summarise the network packets passing
through the edge routers.

A quick description of the sketches is presented in the folders
